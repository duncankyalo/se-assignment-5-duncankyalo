    ANSWERS
    
Step 1: Adding VS Code to the System
Visit the following URL to access VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/ It's the designated gathering place for all things VS Code.
Obtain the installer here: Select "Download for Windows" from the menu. The version that is required for your Windows 11 machine will be known by VS Code.

Launch the installer: Double-click the just downloaded file. You'll be guided through the process by a wizard, who will allow you choose where to install VS Code and add additional features if desired.
Prepare to write code! Select "Finish" to complete the installation process. VS Code is now available for use in your Start menu.

Step 2: Creating a Homey Feel with VS Code
Select a theme: There are light and dark themes in VS Code; you may choose the one that suits your mood. Select your favorite by going to "File" > "Preferences" > "Color Theme" 

Modify the font: Do you like a different font or larger letters? Navigate to "File" > "Preferences" > "Settings" , look up "font" or "font size," and make the necessary adjustments.

Boost using Add-ons: For VS Code, extensions are like superpowers! To locate them, select the "Extensions" view by clicking the symbol in the Activity Bar that resembles a jigsaw piece. The following extensions are essential:
Prettier: Automatically organizes and makes your code appear really tidy. Open the search bar and type ext install prettier.
A useful tool for managing parenthesis and brackets is the Bracket Pair Colorizer. To obtain it, type ext install bracket-pair-colorizer.
You may test your web applications with Live Server without uploading anything. Enter ext install live-server just once.
GitHub Problems and Pull Requests: Perfect for collaborative projects, VS Code allows you to access GitHub directly! To install github-pull-requests-and-issues, type ext install.
Code Executor: Run code snippets with ease and speed. Install code-runner by typing ext.
Personalize the shortcuts you use: Desire to utilize alternative keyboard shortcuts? To modify the keyboard shortcuts to your preference, go to "File" > "Preferences" > "Keyboard Shortcuts" 

Step Three: Exploring Visual Studio Code
The Bar of Activity: This functions similarly to your command center, with icons for all the key tasks you'll perform:
Explorer: For perusing your directories and files. Alternatively, you may open it by pressing  Ctrl+Shift+E (Windows).
To locate text in your files, use search. Press   Ctrl+Shift+F (Windows).
Control of Source: you may open it by pressing  Ctrl+Shift+G (Windows).
Run: To execute and troubleshoot your code.
Debug: For any and all debugging requirements.
Add-ons: to control those fantastic extensions you set up. To access it fast, use Ctrl+Shift+X on Windows.
The Side Bar provides helpful information based on your current activity, such as a file explorer, search results, and debugging information.
The Editor: This is the large section in the middle where your code will be written. You can even use Ctrl+\ or  to open many files at once!
The Status Bar: This bottom bar provides helpful information about the current file you are working on, such as the language you are using and the line number you are on.

Step 4: the Command Palette
Crack it open: In Windows, press Ctrl+Shift+P. With VS Code, it's like having a magic box that opens up endless possibilities!
Locate the necessary items: Enter a command into VS Code, such as "Open Folder," "Create File," "Rename File," or even "Install Extension," and it will provide you with alternatives.
As an illustration:
Get a Folder Open: Enter "Open Folder" and choose the desired folder to work with.
Change a File's Name: Select the file you wish to rename after typing "Rename File".
Put an Extension in Place: Enter "ext install" followed by the desired extension's name (e.g., "ext install prettier").

Step 5: Files and Folders
Make a fresh folder or file:
View in Explorer: With the mouse pointed to the right, select the "Explorer" view. There are choices for creating a "New File" or "New Folder."
Keyboard Shortcut: To swiftly create a new file, use Ctrl+N on Windows.
Launch a folder or file:
Double-clicking any file or folder in Explorer View will open it.
Command Palette: Utilize the Command Palette's "Open Folder" command.
Drag & Drop: To open VS Code, just drag a file or folder from your computer!
Changing files:
View in Explorer: Simply click the desired file or folder.
Keyboard Quick Links: To access the previous file, use Ctrl+Tab (Windows); to access the next file, use Ctrl+Shift+Tab (Windows).
Files Recently Opened: To view your most recent files, you may also utilize the "File" > "Recent" option.
Creating Your Preferences in Step Six
The Configuration: Navigate to "File" > "Preferences" > "Settings" 
Make your code nest unique: You may use the search bar to locate the settings you wish to adjust, or you can make changes directly in the Settings editor.
As an illustration:
Modifying the Subject: Look up "color theme" and select a different theme.
Changing the Font Size: Look for "font size" online and select the appropriate size.
Changing Keybindings: Type "keybindings" into your search engine and modify the shortcuts you wish to use.

Step 7: Debugging: Identifying and Resolving Issues
To enable debugging, select "Run" > "Add Configuration..." and select the debugging configuration (such as "Node.js") that corresponds to your project. In the.vscode folder of your project, Visual Studio Code will generate a launch.json file, which you may modify to customize debugging for your particular project.
Time for Debugging:
Decide on a breakpoint: To halt the execution of your code at that line, click in the left margin.
Begin debugging: In the "Run" view, press F5, or select the "Run and Debug" button.
Go over your code step-by-step: Step Over, Step Into, and Step Out are the controls you may use to navigate line by line through your code.
Check out what's going on by using the "Variables" window for a deeper look or by hovering on variables to view their values.
To continue debugging or to terminate the session, use the "Continue" or "Stop" buttons.
Practical debugging instruments: VS Code provides:
Breaking points: Put a stop to code execution so you can observe the situation.
Step regulators: Go step-by-step through your code.
Keep an eye on variables: Variable values should be monitored when debugging.
Call Stack: View the call history of all functions.

Step 8: Managing Versions with Git
Setting up a repository: Click the "Initialize Repository" button (which resembles a plus sign) after opening the "Source Control" view, which has an icon that resembles a branch. Your project will now include a.git subdirectory, enabling you to monitor changes using Git.
Taking Promises:
Stage modifications: Choose the files from the "Changes" section that you wish to commit.
Commit a message of your choosing: Write a note explaining the changes you made in the message box.
Click the "Commit" button (which resembles a checkmark) to commit.
Using the command "git add" To stage every modification.
git commit -m To commit the staged modifications, go to "Your commit message".
Uploading to GitHub:
Link up with GitHub: Click the "Publish to GitHub" button in the "Source Control" pane.
Promote your modifications: To send your contributions to your GitHub repository, click "Push".
Making Use of Commands:
git push origin main: This command pushes modifications to GitHub's main branch. If needed, replace main with the name of your branch.
